### Lost or Stolen Passport Instructions

If your passport is lost or stolen, you must immediately report the incident to the authorities. Failure to do so can result in the passport being used for illegal activities, and you may be held liable. Once a passport is reported as lost or stolen, it is invalidated and cannot be used for travel, even if you find it later. The details are shared globally through INTERPOL to prevent misuse. You are advised to obtain a new passport immediately.
