# Issuance of National Identity Cards for Dual Citizens

This guide outlines the process for dual citizens to obtain a National Identity Card (NIC). The procedure differs based on the section of the Citizenship Act under which dual citizenship was granted.

## Dual Citizenship under Section 19(2) of Citizenship Act No. 19 of 1948

Under this section, a person's previous Sri Lankan citizenship was revoked and then reacquired. Therefore, the old NIC number will be canceled and a new one will be generated. The Department will issue a letter confirming this change.

### Documents to be Submitted

* Duly completed application form (**D.R.P/1,7,8 form**).
* **Original or a certified copy of the dual citizenship certificate**.
* **Birth certificate** or an extract of the birth registry certified by the Additional District Registrar.
* **Marriage certificate** attested by the Additional District Registrar if applying for a husband's name or surname.
* **ICAO standard photograph** obtained within the last 6 months.
* **Document for handing over the NIC** to the Registration of Persons Division of the Divisional Secretariat.
* **If the application is made more than 6 months after obtaining dual citizenship:** A **declaration** that an NIC was not obtained within the prescribed period and no application was previously made.

### Fees Charged

1.  **NIC issuance fee:** Rs. 200.00
2.  **Registered post fee (Normal Service):** Rs. 120.00
3.  **Fine for late application (exceeding 6 months):** Rs. 2500.00

The application fees can be paid through the certifying officers, while fines should be paid to the Shroff of the relevant Divisional Secretariat.

## Dual Citizenship under Section 19(3) of Citizenship Act No. 19 of 1948

In these cases, there is no revocation of citizenship, so the original NIC number remains valid and can be reacquired.

### Documents to be Submitted

In addition to all the documents mentioned for Section 19(2) above, applicants must also provide:

* **For amendments:** The **previous NIC**.
* **If the NIC is missing:** A **police report**.
* **For first-time applicants over 15 years old:** A **declaration** stating that an NIC was not previously obtained or applied for (**D.R.P/OP/02/3**).

## Naming Conventions for Dual Citizens

* The **name on the Dual Citizenship certificate** is the name that will be used.
* If a different name is requested, the name on the dual citizenship certificate **must first be amended**.
* If the name on the dual citizenship certificate differs from the birth certificate, the **birth certificate must be amended accordingly**.
* A **father's or husband's name/surname** can be included upon request, provided it is mentioned in the dual citizenship certificate and, for a husband's name, a marriage certificate is submitted.

## Address for Dual Citizens

Dual citizens under both Section 19(2) and 19(3) who cannot prove a permanent residence can use a **close relative's or friend's address**. This address must be confirmed using form **D.R.P./OP/01/04** when applying for the NIC.
