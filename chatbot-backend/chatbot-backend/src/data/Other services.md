## Verification of National Identity Card Numbers

The Department for Registration of Persons will promptly verify and correct National Identity Card (NIC) numbers under the following circumstances:

* When an individual applies to **amend or replace a lost NIC**.
* When a service provider requests verification.
* When a financial or other institution notifies the applicant to get the NIC's accuracy checked.
* When the same NIC number has been **issued to two different people**.
* When an NIC number does not match the date of birth or gender due to a departmental error.

## Documents Required for NIC Number Verification

To obtain an NIC number verification letter, you need to submit:

* A **written request** to the Department.
* The **last NIC issued** to you.
* Your **Birth Certificate**.
* **Acceptable written evidence** of the use of the last NIC number, such as a passport, driver's license, bank passbook, or employee provident fund records.
* For a deceased person, all documents mentioned under the instructions for verifying NIC numbers of deceased persons.

### Important Notes:

* You **must have the last NIC** to get a verification letter. If it is lost, damaged, or illegible, you must first obtain a duplicate.
* Verification letters for foreign missions are issued in a **trilingual format**. Therefore, the NIC must be a smart card.
* The NIC holder, or next of kin for a deceased person, must submit the request. An authorized person may submit the request for special reasons (e.g., disability) with a recommendation from the Grama Niladhari.
* A **fee of Rs. 500.00** must be paid for the verification of a deceased person's NIC number.
